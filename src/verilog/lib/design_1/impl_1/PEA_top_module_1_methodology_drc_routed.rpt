TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT FSM2/COMMAND_MEM_CONTROLLER/ram_wr_addr_reg[9]_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-50#1 Warning
Unrealistic path requirement between same-level latches  
There is a timing paths between the source pin FSM2/get_command/en_rd_cmd_reg/G and the destination pin FSM2/get_command/next_instr_reg[0]/D. The two latches are positive level-sensitive with a 0ns path requirement. The 0ns path requirement is coming from the conservative latch analysis and could severely impact the runtime due to time borrowing calculation. It is not recommended to have such topology unless there is a multicycle path constraint to adjust the path requirement to a realistic value (at least half clock period).
